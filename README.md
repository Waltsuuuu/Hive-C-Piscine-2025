# Hive Helsinki - C Piscine 2025 üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Collection of my projects and the documents during the intense 4-week application period at Hive Helsinki.

## What is Hive Helsinki?
Hive Helsinki is a peer-to-peer coding school located in Finland and part of the global 42 Network. It provides a full-time, tuition-free program in software engineering where students learn through project-based work rather than traditional lectures or instructors. The school focuses on self-directed learning, collaboration, and problem solving to develop strong, adaptable programmers ready for real-world challenges.

## What is the C-Piscine?
The most important part of the selection process into Hive is called the Piscine. The Piscine is designed to test endurance, logical thinking, and the ability to learn quickly. It achieves this by immersing candidates in a month-long, hands-on coding bootcamp, where they must solve complex problems, complete numerous projects, and work under tight deadlines, all while learning C programming from scratch.

#### - Exams

Exams were held weekly during the Piscine and followed a strict, isolated format. Each exam lasted four hours and was completed without internet access, external resources, or assistance from peers. The structure was progressive: the first task had to be completed to unlock the next, and failure to solve a task ended the exam. There were up to 10 tasks in total, increasing in difficulty with each level. The final exam was more intensive, offering double the time and double the number of tasks. Questions typically involved writing C programs or re-implementing standard library functions, testing not only technical understanding but also the ability to think critically, adapt quickly, and manage time under pressure.

#### - Rushes

Rushes took place on weekends and were team-based projects designed to test collaboration, problem-solving, and time management. Unlike the solo projects and exams during the week, Rushes required close cooperation between Pisciners to complete large-scale programming challenges under strict deadlines. These projects simulated real-world development environments, emphasizing the importance of communication, teamwork, and effective task division alongside technical proficiency.



#### - Schedule
- Mon-Thu: Solo projects and peer evaluations.
- Friday: Exam day.
- Sat-Sun: Rush (Team based projects).

## Projects

Here's a breakdown of the directories and their contents:

- `Shell00/`, `Shell01/`: Basic shell scripting and command-line skills
- `C00/` to `C13/`: Core C programming projects, each building upon the last
- `Rush00/`, `Rush01/`, etc.: Weekend team-based coding challenges focused on problem-solving and collaboration

In each directory, there is a **subject.pdf** file, which contains the official project instructions and requirement. These documents outline the expected functionality, allowed functions, and coding standards for each task.

## So, how did I do?
Completed projects:
- C00 - C08.

Rushes:
- Rush 00 - 116%
- Rush 01 - Attempted, but failed.
- Rush 02 - No attempt.

Exam grades:
- Exam 00	- 10%
- Exam 01	- 60%
- Exam 02	- 80%
- Final - 60%


## What I Learned

- Navigating and using the shell and command-line tools efficiently  
- The fundamentals of C programming: *variables, functions, loops, arrays, pointers, and memory management* 
- Writing clean, readable code that follows a strict coding standard (*The Norm*)  
- Reinforcing my understanding of concepts through peer discussions, collaboration, and explaining ideas to others  
- The value of being part of a motivated, supportive, and collaborative community

## Reflections

Overall the Piscine was a wonderful learning experience that I would happily recommend to anyone curious about programming! Even if you do not make it in to Hive, the Piscine itself already holds great value. 

The Piscine brought together people from all walks of life, with different skills and backgrounds, each brining in a unique perspective. In the end, the quality that everyone shared was the eagerness to learn. 

Collaboration and peer learning played a key role in personal growth. Long days, shared challenges, and the collective drive to improve created a supportive and motivating atmosphere. It was not only a technical bootcamp, but also a powerful lesson in perseverance, communication, and self-reliance.

Coming into the Piscine, I had a bit of background in web development, but this was my first real exposure to lower-level programming. Working with C and understanding how things function closer to the hardware level sparked a genuine interest in systems programming and deepened my understanding of how computers work under the hood.
